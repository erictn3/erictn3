Software Engineer with proven leadership skills while working effectively as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team. Recognized for maintaining excellence and a keen eye for design, this led to a series of promotions over a very successful career in the service and marketing industry. After rediscovering a passion as a software developer, I’ve fully dedicated myself to learn and grow and improve my coding abilities. I supported 8 programmers with focused communication so that the skills and productivity are respectfully shown through our team-based projects. I am now excited to showcase my problem-solving abilities and collaborative spirit for software engineering on a talented, results-oriented development team.
